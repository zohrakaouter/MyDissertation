	abstract = {In November 2000, the OMG made public the MDA™ initiative, a particular variant of a new global trend called MDE (Model Driven Engineering). The basic ideas of MDA are germane to many other approaches such as generative programming, domain specific languages, model-integrated computing, generic model management, software factories, etc. MDA may be defined as the realization of MDE principles around a set of OMG standards like MOF, XMI, OCL, UML, CWM, SPEM, etc. MDE is presently making several promises about the potential benefits that could be reaped from a move from code-centric to model-based practices. When we observe these claims, we may wonder when they may be satisfied: on the short, medium or long term or even never perhaps for some of them. This paper tries to propose a vision of the development of MDE based on some lessons learnt in the past 30 years in the development of object technology. The main message is that a basic principle ("Everything is an object") was most helpful in driving the technology in the direction of simplicity, generality and power of integration. Similarly in MDE, the basic principle that "Everything is a model" has many interesting properties, among others the capacity to generate a realistic research agenda. We postulate here that two core relations (representation and conformance) are associated to this principle, as inheritance and instantiation were associated to the object unification principle in the class-based languages of the 80's. We suggest that this may be most useful in understanding many questions about MDE in general and the MDA approach in particular. We provide some illustrative examples. The personal position taken in this paper would be useful if it could generate a critical debate on the research directions in MDE. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

	abstract = {Model Driven Architecture (MDA1 )is anap- proach to application modeling and generation that has received a lot of attention in recent months. Champi- oned by the Object Management Group (OMG), many organizations are now looking at the ideas of MDA as a way to organize andmanage their application solutions, tool vendors are explicitly referring to their capabilities in terms of “MDA compliance”, and the MDA lexicon of platform-specific and platform-independent models is now widely referenced in the industry. In spite of this interest and market support, there is little clear guidance on what MDA means, where we are in its evolution, what is possible with today's technology, and howto take advantage of it in practice.This paper addresses that need by providing ananalysis ofhowmodeling is used in industry today, the relevance ofMDAto today's systems, a classification ofMDA tooling support, and ex- amples of its use.The paper concludeswith a set of recom- mendations for howMDAcan be successful in practice},

	abstract = {Metamodels play a significant role to describe and analyze the relations between domain concepts. They are also cornerstone to build a software language (SL) for a domain and its associated tooling. Metamodel definition generally drives code generation of a core API. The latter is further enriched by developers with additional code implementing advanced functionalities, e.g., checkers, recommenders, etc. When a SL is evolved to the next version, the metamodels are evolved as well before to re-generate the core API code. As a result, the developers added code both in the core API and the SL toolings may be impacted and thus may need to be co-evolved accordingly. Many approaches support the co-evolution of various artifacts when metamodels evolve. However, not the co-evolution of code. This paper fills this gap. We propose a semi-automatic co-evolution approach based on change propagation. The premise is that knowledge of the metamodel evolution changes can be propagated by means of resolutions to drive the code co-evolution. Our approach leverages on the abstraction level of metamodels where a given metamodel element has often different usages in the code. It supports alternative co-evaluations to meet different developers needs. Our work is evaluated on three Eclipse SL implementations, namely OCL, Modisco, and Papyrus over several evolved versions of metamodels and code. In response to five different evolved metamodels, we co-evolved 976 impacts over 18 projects.A comparison of our co-evolved code with the versioned ones shows the usefulness of our approach. Our approach was able to reach a weighted average of 87.4\% and 88.9\% respectively of precision and recall while supporting useful alternative co-evolution that developers have manually performed.},

	abstract = {Modeling languages and thus their metamodels are subject to change. When a metamodel is evolved, existing models may no longer conform to it. Manual migration of these models in response to metamodel evolution is tedious and error-prone. To significantly automate model migration, operator-based approaches provide reusable coupled operators that encapsulate both metamodel evolution and model migration. The success of an operator-based approach highly depends on the library of reusable coupled operators it provides. In this paper, we thus present an extensive catalog of coupled operators that is based both on a literature survey as well as real-life case studies. The catalog is organized according to a number of criteria to ease assessing the impact on models as well as selecting the right operator for a metamodel change at hand. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Khelladi2016,
	abstract = {Evolution of metamodels can be represented at the finest grain by the trace of atomic changes such as add, delete, and update of elements. For many applications, like automatic correction of models when the metamodel evolves, a higher grained trace must be inferred, composed of complex changes, each one aggregating several atomic changes. Complex change detection is a challenging task since multiple sequences of atomic changes may define a single user intention and complex changes may overlap over the atomic change trace. In this paper, we propose a detection engine of complex changes that simultaneously addresses these two challenges of variability and overlap. We introduce three ranking heuristics to help users to decide which overlapping complex changes are likely to be correct. In our approach, we record the trace of atomic changes rather than computing them with the difference between the original and evolved metamodel. Thus, we have a complete and an ordered sequence of atomic changes without hidden changes. Furthermore, we consider the issue of undo operations (i.e. change canceling actions) while recording the sequence of atomic changes, and we illustrate how we cope with it. We validate our approach on 8 real case studies demonstrating its feasibility and its applicability. We observe that a full recall is always reached in all case studies and an average precision of 70.75\%. The precision is improved by the heuristics up to 91\% and 100\% in some cases.},

The promises are many; among them improved software quality by increased traceability between artifacts, early defect detection, reducing manual and error-prone work and including knowledge in generators. However, in our opinion MDE is still in the early adoption phase and to be successfully adopted by industry, it must prove its superiority over other development paradigms and be supported by a rich ecosystem of stable, compatible and standardized tools. It should also not introduce more complexity than it removes. The subject of this paper is the challenges in MDE adoption from our experience of using MDE in real and research projects, where MDE has potential for success and what the key success criteria are.},

Given that this API evolves frequently, app developers are periodically required to migrate API usages in their apps to ensure that the apps behave as expected when running on the new API. To help developers with this tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming task, we defined a technique for automated API migration and implemented it in a tool called APIMigrator that supports Android apps. APIMigrator (1) automatically migrates API usages within an app by leveraging how developers of other apps migrated corresponding API usages and (2) validates the migrations through differential testing. We evaluated APIMigrator on a benchmark of 15 real-world apps and obtained promising results. Overall, our tool was able to migrate 85\% of the API usages considered and validate 68\% of these migrations. We provide a demo video of the tool at https://youtu.be/v0VfpKi_IDc.},

	abstract = {Cloud services are programmatically accessed through REST APIs. Since REST APIs are constantly evolving, an important problem is how to prevent breaking changes of APIs, while supporting several different versions. To find such breaking changes in an automated way, we introduce differential regression testing for REST APIs. Our approach is based on two observations. First, breaking changes in REST APIs involve two software components, namely the client and the service. As such, there are also two types of regressions: regressions in the API specification, i.e., in the contract between the client and the service, and regressions in the service itself, i.e., previously working requests are "broken" in later versions of the service. Finding both kinds of regressions involves testing along two dimensions: when the service changes and when the specification changes. Second, to detect such bugs automatically, we employ differential testing. That is, we compare the behavior of different versions on the same inputs against each other, and find regressions in the observed differences. For generating inputs (sequences of HTTP requests) to services, we use RESTler, a stateful fuzzer for REST APIs. Comparing the outputs (HTTP responses) of a cloud service involves several challenges, like abstracting over minor differences, handling out-of-order requests, and non-determinism. Differential regression testing across 17 different versions of the widely-used Azure networking APIs deployed between 2016 and 2019 detected 14 regressions in total, 5 of those in the official API specifications and 9 regressions in the services themselves.},

	year = {2013},
	isbn = {9781467330763},
	publisher = {IEEE Press},
	abstract = {Adding features and fixing bugs often require sys- tematic edits that make similar, but not identical, changes to many code locations. Finding all the relevant locations and making the correct edits is a tedious and error-prone process for developers. This paper addresses both problems using edit scripts learned from multiple examples. We design and implement a tool called LASE that (1) creates a context-aware edit script from two or more examples, and uses the script to (2) automatically identify edit locations and to (3) transform the code. We evaluate LASE on an oracle test suite of systematic edits from Eclipse JDT and SWT. LASE finds edit locations with 99\% precision and 89\% recall, and transforms them with 91\% accuracy. We also evaluate LASE on 37 example systematic edits from other open source programs and find LASE is accurate and effective. Furthermore, we confirmed with developers that LASE found edit locations which they missed. Our novel algorithm that learns from multiple examples is critical to achieving high precision and recall; edit scripts created from only one example produce too many false positives, false negatives, or both. Our results indicate that LASE should help developers in automating systematic editing. Whereas most prior work either suggests edit locations or performs simple edits, LASE is the first to do both for nontrivial program edits.},

It is difficult for library maintainers to answer this simple---yet essential!---question when evolving their libraries. Library maintainers are constantly balancing between two opposing positions: make changes at the risk of breaking some of their clients, or avoid changes and maintain compatibility at the cost of immobility and growing technical debt. We argue that the lack of objective usage data and tool support leaves maintainers with their own subjective perception of their community to make these decisions.We introduce BreakBot, a bot that analyses the pull requests of Java libraries on GitHub to identify the breaking changes they introduce and their impact on client projects. Through static analysis of libraries and clients, it extracts and summarizes objective data that enrich the code review process by providing maintainers with the appropriate information to decide whether---and how---changes should be accepted, directly in the pull requests.},

	abstract = {Abstract In software engineering, a software development process, also known as software development life cycle (SDLC), involves several distinct activities for developing, testing, maintaining, and evolving a software system. Within the stages of SDLC, software maintenance occupies most of the total cost of the software life. However, after extended maintenance activities, software quality always degrades due to increasing size and complexity. To solve this problem, software modularisation using clustering is an intuitive way to modularise and classify code into small pieces. , A multi-pattern clustering (MPC) algorithm for software modularisation is proposed in this study. The proposed MPC algorithm can be divided into five different steps: (1) preprocessing, (2) file labelling, (3) collection of chain dependencies, (4) hierarchical agglomerative clustering, (5) modification of the clustering result. The performance of the proposed MPC algorithm to selected clustering techniques is compared by using three open-source and one closed-source software programs. Experimental results show that the modularisation quality of the proposed MPC algorithm is nearly 1.6 times better than that of the expert decomposition. Additionally, compared to other software clustering algorithms, the proposed MPC algorithm, on average, has a 13\% enhancement in producing results similar to human thinking. Consequently, it can be seen that the proposed MPC algorithm is suitable for human comprehension while producing better module quality compared to other clustering algorithms.},

	abstract = {Summary Search-based techniques have been applied successfully to the task of generating unit tests for object-oriented software. However, as for any meta-heuristic search, the efficiency heavily depends on many factors; seeding, which refers to the use of previous related knowledge to help solve the testing problem at hand, is one such factor that may strongly influence this efficiency. This paper investigates different seeding strategies for unit test generation, in particular seeding of numerical and string constants derived statically and dynamically, seeding of type information and seeding of previously generated tests. To understand the effects of these seeding strategies, the results of a large empirical analysis carried out on a large collection of open-source projects from the SF110 corpus and the Apache Commons repository are reported. These experiments show with strong statistical confidence that, even for a testing tool already able to achieve high coverage, the use of appropriate seeding strategies can further improve performance. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {API developers evolve software libraries to fix bugs, add new features, or refactor code, but the evolution can introduce API-breaking changes (e.g., API renaming). To benefit from such evolution, the programmers of client projects have to repetitively upgrade the callsites of libraries, since API-breaking changes introduce many compilation errors. It is tedious and error-prone to resolve such errors, especially when programmers are often unfamiliar with the API usages of newer versions. To migrate client code, the prior approaches either mine API mappings or learn edit scripts, but both the research lines have inherent limitations. For example, mappings alone cannot handle complex cases, and there is no sufficient source (e.g., migration commits) for learning edit scripts.In this paper, we propose a new research direction. When a library is replaced with a newer version, each type of API-breaking change introduces a type of compilation error. For example, renaming the name of an API method causes undefined-method errors at its callsites. Based on this observation, we propose to resolve errors that are introduced by migration, according to their locations and types that are reported by compilers. In this way, a migration tool can incrementally migrate complex cases, even without any change examples. Towards this direction, we propose the first approach, called LibCatch. It defines 14 migration operators, and in a compiler-directed way, it exploits the combinations of migration operators to generate migration solutions, until its predefined criteria are satisfied. We conducted two evaluations. In the first evaluation, we use LibCatch to handle 123 migration tasks. LibCatch reduced migration-related compilation errors for 92.7\% of tasks, and eliminated such errors for 32.4\% of tasks. We inspect the tasks whose errors are eliminated, and find that 33.9\% of them produce identical edits to manual migration edits. In the second evaluation, we use two tools and LibCatch to migrate 15 real client projects in the wild. LibCatch resolved all compilation errors of 7 projects, and reduced the compilation errors of 6 other projects to no more than two errors. As a comparison, the compared two tools reduced the compilation errors of only 1 project.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we attempt to address the relative absence of empirical studies of model driven engineering through describing the practices of three commercial organizations as they adopted a model driven engineering approach to their software development. Using in-depth semi-structured interviewing we invited practitioners to reflect on their experiences and selected three to use as exemplars or case studies. In documenting some details of attempts to deploy model driven practices, we identify some 'lessons learned', in particular the importance of complex organizational, managerial and social factors - as opposed to simple technical factors - in the relative success, or failure, of the endeavour. As an example of organizational change management the successful deployment of model driven engineering appears to require: a progressive and iterative approach; transparent organizational commitment and motivation; integration with existing organizational processes and a clear business focus.},

	abstract = {In November 2000, the OMG made public the MDA™initiative, a particular variant of a new global trend called MDE (Model Driven Engineering). The basic ideas of MDA are germane to many other approaches such as generative programming, domain specific languages, model-integrated computing, generic model management, software factories, etc. MDA may be defined as the realization of MDE principles around a set of OMG standards like MOF, XMI, OCL, UML, CWM, SPEM, etc. MDE is presently making several promises about the potential benefits that could be reaped from a move from code-centric to model-based practices. When we observe these claims, we may wonder when they may be satisfied: on the short, medium or long term or even never perhaps for some of them. This paper tries to propose a vision of the development of MDE based on some lessons learnt in the past 30 years in the development of object technology. The main message is that a basic principle ("Everything is an object") was most helpful in driving the technology in the direction of simplicity, generality and power of integration. Similarly in MDE, the basic principle that "Everything is a model" has many interesting properties, among others the capacity to generate a realistic research agenda. We postulate here that two core relations (representation and conformance) are associated to this principle, as inheritance and instantiation were associated to the object unification principle in the class-based languages of the 80's. We suggest that this may be most useful in understanding many questions about MDE in general and the MDA approach in particular. We provide some illustrative examples. The personal position taken in this paper would be useful if it could generate a critical debate on the research directions in MDE.},
